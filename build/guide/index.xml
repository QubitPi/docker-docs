      <title>Build arguments</title>

      <description>Build arguments is a great way to add flexibility to your builds. You can pass build arguments at build-time, and you can set a default value that the builder uses as a fallback.&#xA;Change runtime versions A practical use case for build arguments is to specify runtime versions for build stages. Your image uses the golang:1.21-alpine image as a base image. But what if someone wanted to use a different version of Go for building the application?</description>

      <title>Export binaries</title>

      <description>Did you know that you can use Docker to build your application to standalone binaries? Sometimes, you don’t want to package and distribute your application as a Docker image. Use Docker to build your application, and use exporters to save the output to disk.&#xA;The default output format for docker build is a container image. That image is automatically loaded to your local image store, where you can run a container from that image, or push it to a registry.</description>

      <description>The starting resources for this guide include a simple Go project and a Dockerfile. From this starting point, the guide illustrates various ways that you can improve how you build the application with Docker.&#xA;Environment setup To follow this guide:&#xA;Install Docker Desktop or Docker Engine Clone or create a new repository from the application example on GitHub The application The example project for this guide is a client-server application for translating messages to a fictional language.</description>

      <title>Layers</title>

      <description>The order of Dockerfile instructions matters. A Docker build consists of a series of ordered build instructions. Each instruction in a Dockerfile roughly translates to an image layer. The following diagram illustrates how a Dockerfile translates into a stack of layers in a container image.&#xA;Cached layers When you run a build, the builder attempts to reuse layers from earlier builds. If a layer of an image is unchanged, then the builder picks it up from the build cache.</description>

      <title>Mounts</title>

      <guid>https://docker.qubitpi.org/build/guide/mounts/</guid>
      <description>This section describes how to use cache mounts and bind mounts with Docker builds.&#xA;Cache mounts let you specify a persistent package cache to be used during builds. The persistent cache helps speed up build steps, especially steps that involve installing packages using a package manager. Having a persistent cache for packages means that even if you rebuild a layer, you only download new or changed packages.&#xA;Cache mounts are created using the --mount flag together with the RUN instruction in the Dockerfile.</description>

      <title>Multi-platform</title>

      <guid>https://docker.qubitpi.org/build/guide/multi-platform/</guid>
      <description>Up until this point in the guide, you&#39;ve built Linux binaries. This section describes how you can support other operating systems, and architectures, using multi-platform builds via emulation and cross-compilation.&#xA;The easiest way to get started with building for multiple platforms is using emulation. With emulation, you can build your app to multiple architectures without having to make any changes to your Dockerfile. All you need to do is to pass the --platform flag to the build command, specifying the OS and architecture you want to build for.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage</title>
      <link>https://docker.qubitpi.org/build/guide/multi-stage/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docker.qubitpi.org/build/guide/multi-stage/</guid>
      <description>This section explores multi-stage builds. There are two main reasons for why you’d want to use multi-stage builds:&#xA;They allow you to run build steps in parallel, making your build pipeline faster and more efficient. They allow you to create a final image with a smaller footprint, containing only what&#39;s needed to run your program. In a Dockerfile, a build stage is represented by a FROM instruction. The Dockerfile from the previous section doesn’t leverage multi-stage builds.</description>

      <description>This guide has demonstrated some of the build features and capabilities that Docker provides.&#xA;If you would like to continue learning about Docker build, consider exploring the following resources:&#xA;BuildKit: deep-dive into the open source build engine that powers your Docker builds Drivers: configure for how and where your Docker builds run Exporters: save your build results to different output formats Bake: orchestrate your build workflows Attestations: annotate your build artifacts with metadata Continuous integration: run Docker builds in CI Feedback If you have suggestions for improving the content of this guide, you can use the feedback widget to submit your feedback.</description>

      <title>Test</title>

      <description>This section focuses on testing. The example in this section focuses on linting, but the same principles apply for other kinds of tests as well, such as unit tests. Code linting is a static analysis of code that helps you detect errors, style violations, and anti-patterns.&#xA;The exact steps for how to test your code can vary a lot depending on the programming language or framework that you use. The example application used in this guide is written in Go.</description>
