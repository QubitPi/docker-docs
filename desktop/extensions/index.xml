      <description>Install an extension not available in the Marketplace Warning&#xA;Docker Extensions that are not in the Marketplace haven&#39;t gone through Docker&#39;s review process. Extensions can install binaries, invoke commands and access files on your machine. Installing them is at your own risk.&#xA;The Extensions Marketplace is the trusted and official place to install extensions from within Docker Desktop. These extensions have gone through a review process by Docker. However, other extensions can also be installed in Docker Desktop if you trust the extension author.</description>
