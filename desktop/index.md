Docker Desktop


Docker Desktop is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment
that lets you build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices. 

It provides a straightforward GUI (Graphical User Interface) that lets you manage your containers, applications, and images directly from your machine. 

Docker Desktop reduces the time spent on complex setups so you can focus on writing code. It takes care of port mappings, file system concerns, and other default settings, and is regularly updated with bug fixes and security updates.

Docker Desktop integrates with your preferred development tools and languages, and gives you access to a vast ecosystem of trusted images and templates via Docker Hub. This empowers teams to accelerate development, automate builds, enable CI/CD workflows, and collaborate securely through shared repositories.
