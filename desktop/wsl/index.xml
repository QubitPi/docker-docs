      <description>Always use the latest version of WSL. At a minimum you must use WSL version 1.1.3.0., otherwise Docker Desktop may not work as expected. Testing, development, and documentation is based on the newest kernel versions. Older versions of WSL can cause:&#xA;Docker Desktop to hang periodically or when upgrading Deployment via SCCM to fail The vmmem.exe to consume all memory Network filter policies to be applied globally, not to specific objects GPU failures with containers To get the best out of the file system performance when bind-mounting files, it&#39;s recommended that you store source code and other data that is bind-mounted into Linux containers.</description>

      <description>The following section describes how to start developing your applications using Docker and WSL 2. We recommend that you have your code in your default Linux distribution for the best development experience using Docker and WSL 2. After you have turned on the WSL 2 feature on Docker Desktop, you can start working with your code inside the Linux distro and ideally with your IDE still in Windows. This workflow is straightforward if you are using VS Code.</description>
