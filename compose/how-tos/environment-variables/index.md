Environment variables in Compose


By leveraging environment variables and interpolation in Docker Compose, you can create versatile and reusable configurations, making your Dockerized applications easier to manage and deploy across different environments. 

> [!TIP]
>
> Before using environment variables, read through all of the information first to get a full picture of environment variables in Docker Compose.

This section covers:

- [How to set environment variables within your container's environment](set-environment-variables.md).
- [How environment variable precedence works within your container's environment](envvars-precedence.md).
- [Pre-defined environment variables](envvars.md).

It also covers: 
- How [interpolation](variable-interpolation.md) can be used to set variables within your Compose file and how it relates to a container's environment.
- Some [best practices](best-practices.md).
