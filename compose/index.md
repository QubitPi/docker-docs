Docker Compose


Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. 
It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience. 

Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services
from your configuration file.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as
well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

 * Start, stop, and rebuild services
 * View the status of running services
 * Stream the log output of running services
 * Run a one-off command on a service
