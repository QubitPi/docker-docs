      <title>Add nodes to the swarm</title>

      <description>Once you&#39;ve created a swarm with a manager node, you&#39;re ready to add worker nodes.&#xA;Open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you want to run a worker node. This tutorial uses the name worker1.&#xA;Run the command produced by the docker swarm init output from the Create a swarm tutorial step to create a worker node joined to the existing swarm:&#xA;$ docker swarm join \ --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \ 192.</description>

      <title>Apply rolling updates to a service</title>

      <description>In a previous step of the tutorial, you scaled the number of instances of a service. In this part of the tutorial, you deploy a service based on the Redis 3.0.6 container tag. Then you upgrade the service to use the Redis 3.0.7 container image using rolling updates.&#xA;If you haven&#39;t already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named manager1.</description>

      <title>Create a swarm</title>

      <description>After you complete the tutorial setup steps, you&#39;re ready to create a swarm. Make sure the Docker Engine daemon is started on the host machines.&#xA;Open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you want to run your manager node. This tutorial uses a machine named manager1.&#xA;Run the following command to create a new swarm:&#xA;$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr &amp;lt;MANAGER-IP&amp;gt; In the tutorial, the following command creates a swarm on the manager1 machine:</description>

      <title>Delete the service running on the swarm</title>

      <description>The remaining steps in the tutorial don&#39;t use the helloworld service, so now you can delete the service from the swarm.&#xA;If you haven&#39;t already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named manager1.&#xA;Run docker service rm helloworld to remove the helloworld service.&#xA;$ docker service rm helloworld helloworld Run docker service inspect &amp;lt;SERVICE-ID&amp;gt; to verify that the swarm manager removed the service.</description>

      <title>Deploy a service to the swarm</title>

      <description>After you create a swarm, you can deploy a service to the swarm. For this tutorial, you also added worker nodes, but that is not a requirement to deploy a service.&#xA;Open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named manager1.&#xA;Run the following command:&#xA;$ docker service create --replicas 1 --name helloworld alpine ping docker.com 9uk4639qpg7npwf3fn2aasksr The docker service create command creates the service.</description>

      <title>Drain a node on the swarm</title>
      <link>https://docker.qubitpi.org/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/drain-node/</link>

      <guid>https://docker.qubitpi.org/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/drain-node/</guid>
      <description>In earlier steps of the tutorial, all the nodes have been running with Active availability. The swarm manager can assign tasks to any Active node, so up to now all nodes have been available to receive tasks.&#xA;Sometimes, such as planned maintenance times, you need to set a node to Drain availability. Drain availability prevents a node from receiving new tasks from the swarm manager. It also means the manager stops tasks running on the node and launches replica tasks on a node with Active availability.</description>

      <title>Inspect a service on the swarm</title>
      <link>https://docker.qubitpi.org/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/inspect-service/</link>

      <description>When you have deployed a service to your swarm, you can use the Docker CLI to see details about the service running in the swarm.&#xA;If you haven&#39;t already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named manager1.&#xA;Run docker service inspect --pretty &amp;lt;SERVICE-ID&amp;gt; to display the details about a service in an easily readable format.</description>

      <title>Scale the service in the swarm</title>

      <description>Once you have deployed a service to a swarm, you are ready to use the Docker CLI to scale the number of containers in the service. Containers running in a service are called tasks.&#xA;If you haven&#39;t already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named manager1.&#xA;Run the following command to change the desired state of the service running in the swarm:</description>
