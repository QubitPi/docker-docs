      <description>Note&#xA;Docker Core subscription payments support 3D secure authentication.&#xA;3D Secure (3DS) authentication incorporates an additional security layer for credit card transactions. If you’re making payments for your Docker billing in a region that requires 3DS, or using a payment method that requires 3DS, you’ll need to verify your identity to complete any transactions. The method used to verify your identity varies depending on your banking institution.&#xA;The following transactions will use 3DS authentication if your payment method requires it.</description>
