Securing your software supply chain with Docker Scout


When container images are insecure, significant risks can arise. Around 60% of
organizations have reported experiencing at least one security breach or
vulnerability incident within a year, [resulting in operational
disruption][CSA]. These incidents often result in considerable downtime, with
44% of affected companies experiencing over an hour of downtime per event. The
financial impact is substantial, with [the average data breach cost reaching
$4.45 million][IBM]. This highlights the critical importance of maintaining
robust container security measures.

Docker Scout enhances container security by providing automated vulnerability
detection and remediation, addressing insecure container images, and ensuring
compliance with security standards.
