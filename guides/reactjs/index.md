React.js language-specific guide


The React.js language-specific guide shows you how to containerize a React.js application using Docker, following best practices for creating efficient, production-ready containers.

[React.js](https://react.dev/) is a widely used library for building interactive user interfaces. However, managing dependencies, environments, and deployments efficiently can be complex. Docker simplifies this process by providing a consistent and containerized environment.

## What will you learn?

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Containerize and run a React.js application using Docker.
- Set up a local development environment for React.js inside a container. 
- Run tests for your React.js application within a Docker container.
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for your containerized app.
- Deploy the containerized React.js application to a local Kubernetes cluster for testing and debugging.

To begin, you’ll start by containerizing an existing React.js application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you're familiar with the following:

- Basic understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- Basic knowledge of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) for managing dependencies and running scripts.
- Familiarity with [React.js](https://react.dev/) fundamentals.
- Understanding of Docker concepts such as images, containers, and Dockerfiles. If you're new to Docker, start with the [Docker basics](/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container.md) guide.

Once you've completed the React.js getting started modules, you’ll be ready to containerize your own React.js application using the examples and instructions provided in this guide.
