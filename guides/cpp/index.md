- Containerize and run a C++ application using a multi-stage Docker build
- Build and run a C++ application using Docker Compose
- Set up a local environment to develop a C++ application using containers
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized C++ application using GitHub Actions
- Deploy your containerized application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment
- Use BuildKit to generate SBOM attestations during the build process

After completing the C++ getting started modules, you should be able to containerize your own C++ application based on the examples and instructions provided in this guide.

Start by containerizing an existing C++ application.
