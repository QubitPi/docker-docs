The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) guide teaches you how to containerize an existing RAG application using Docker. The example application is a RAG that acts like a sommelier, giving you the best pairings between wines and food. In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Containerize and run a RAG application
- Set up a local environment to run the complete RAG stack locally for development

Start by containerizing an existing RAG application.
