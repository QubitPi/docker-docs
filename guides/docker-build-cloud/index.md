Docker Build Cloud: Reclaim your time with fast, multi-architecture builds


<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->

98% of developers spend up to an hour every day waiting for builds to finish
([Incredibuild: 2022 Big Dev Build Times](https://www.incredibuild.com/survey-report-2022)).
Heavy, complex builds can become a major roadblock for development teams,
slowing down both local development and CI/CD pipelines.

Docker Build Cloud speeds up image build times to improve developer
productivity, reduce frustrations, and help you shorten the release cycle.

## Who’s this for?

- Anyone who wants to tackle common causes of slow image builds: limited local
  resources, slow emulation, and lack of build collaboration across a team.
- Developers working on older machines who want to build faster.
- Development teams working on the same repository who want to cut wait times
  with a shared cache.
- Developers performing multi-architecture builds who don’t want to spend hours
  configuring and rebuilding for emulators.

## What you’ll learn

- Building container images faster locally and in CI
- Accelerating builds for multi-platform images
- Reusing pre-built images to expedite workflows

## Tools integration

Works well with Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, and other CI solutions
